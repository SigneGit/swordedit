#summary swordedit TODO
Here is the to-do list for the swordedit project.

== To Be Completed ==

  # Write scenario-entity abstraction for the scenario class to remove explicit data-structure references
  # Write a BSP / Model / Bitmap rendering class that is not explicetly connected to a GUI-object
  # Rewrite the RenderView class so it only serves as the controller for the NIB-object
  # Rewrite the SpawnEditorController class so it uses data-structure abstraction
  # Rewrite the ModelTag class so it only serves as a data reading / storage class
  # Remove the BitmapView and ModelView classes - replace them with connections to the RenderView controller and have them served by the rendering class.
  # Update with better PPC support
  # Fix the object-selection problems (ie you click on an object and swordedit misses it slightly or selects the adjacent object)
  # Add full-screen support with OpenGL rendered menus
